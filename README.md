### License 

This program is to demonstrate an implementation of tetris in the browser. It is a small project I made to get my feet wet in online game development. Sprites were created using [aesprite](http://www.aseprite.org/). All code and images are licensed underGPLv2, a copy of which is included as LICENSE.
